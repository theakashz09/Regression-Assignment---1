        "Gradient descent helps machine learning models learn the optimal parameters by adjusting them in the direction that minimizes the error between predictions and actual outcomes. While gradient descent is widely used, setting the learning rate is crucial. If the learning rate is too large, the algorithm might overshoot the minimum, and if it's too small, convergence can be slow."
